# Overview

I am attempting to learn the basics of R. Because R is commonly used in data analysis and statistics, I sought to write a software that involved mathematical operations.

This software performs basic arithemtic operations on pairs of numbers that the user inputs. It starts off with prompting the user for numbers in pairs, stopping when the user submits two empty inputs. It then calculates the sum, difference, product, quotient, and the result of exponentiation. All of the calculated values are included in a data frame before the software finishes running. 

In the future, I hope to include a function that calculates the derivative of a power function. 

The purpose of this software was to familiarize myself with the syntax that R uses. By writing this software, I was successful in my purpose.

# Development Environment

I used Virtual Studio Code to develop this software.

The language used in this software was R.
